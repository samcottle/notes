# Learning Dutch

Duolingo is great, but it's nice to have a cheat sheet to help you as you're learning. So here are rough notes that I took whilst learning Dutch.

## Adjectives

Generally speaking, an adjective that comes before a definitive noun gets a **-e**. For example:

> De oude hond.

And:

> Het grote huis.

But if it's before an indefinite noun (**a** something, or **an** something), **de** words get a **-e**, but **het** words don't. For example:

> Een oude hond.

But:

> Een groot huis.

If there's no article, then use the same rule as indefinite. For example:

> Lekkere koffie. (de)

And:

> Koud water. (het)

## Verbs

As a rule of thumb, Dutch uses what is called _V2 word order_. This is where the verb is the second element in a sentence. For example:

> Ik eet een boterham.

(As another rule of thumb, the Dutch language has so many exceptions that you can't take any rule as gospel. That includes this rule around V2 word order.)

### Inversion

Words can also be places at the beginning of a sentence to give them emphasis. This is called _inversion_. For example, if you want to emphasize that you're eating that sandwich _now_:

> **Nu** eet ik een boterham.

### Adverbs

Adverbs tell you something about the time, place or manner of a verb/adjective. Where you place the adverb depends on whether it is definite (**the** something) or indefinite (**a** something).

Adverbs come after a definite object. For example:

> Ik eet de boterham **nu**. (I am eating **the** sandwich now)

But before an indefinite object. For example:

> Ik eet **nu** _een_ boterham. (I am eating **a** sandwich now)

### Separable verbs

These are verbs that can be split in two parts (a prefix and a verb), with each part moved around in the sentence.

While _separable verbs_ don't exist in English, they are similar to what are known as _phrasal verbs_, like _stand up_, _write down_, _fill in_, and _hang out_.

Some examples of separable verbs being split:

- _Aantrekken_: Ik _trek_ mijn schoenen niet _aan_. (I am not putting on my shoes.)
- _Binnenkomen_: Zij _komt_ de kamer _binnen_. (She enters the room.)

In the case of **finite** verbs, the prefix moves to the end of the sentence and the verb takes its usual place (example: Jij _raakt_ mij _aan_ - you touch me). There is an exception to this in the case of subordinate clauses, where the finite verb is always moved to the end of the sentence. (Example: Ik word boos, als jij me _aanraakt_. - I will become angry if you touch me.)

For **infinitives** (a verb with the word _to_ in front of it), the separable verb is written as one word. (Jij wil me _aanraken_. - You want _to touch_ me.)

In the case of **past participles** (a verb with _ed_ at the end of it), a _ge_ is also placed between the two parts. For example, _opgeven_ (to give up) becomes _opgegeven_ (given up).

## Conjunctions

These are used to connect two sentences or phrases. The most commonly used conjunctions are _en_, _of_, _maar_, _want_, and _dus_.

Nearly all other conjunctions are referred to as _subordinating conjunctions_ (i.e. they have a subordinate clause: one that can't function as a sentence in its own right). Examples include:

- Contrast: _hoewel_ (although/even though)
- Cause: _omdat_ (because), _doordat_ (because)
- Consequence: _zodat_ (so that)
- Condition: _als_ (as/if), _tenzij_ (unless)
- Time: _terwijl_ (while), _zodra_ (as soon), _wanneer_ (when), _totdat_ (until), _voordat_ (before)

These use a different word order. Instead of the verb-second word order, the verbs in subordinate clauses are always at the end. For example:

> Het boek is duur, omdat het oud **is** (the book is expensive because it is old).

But when the subordinate clause comes before the main clause (which is done for emphasis), then the main clause is inverted (the subject and verb switch places). for example:

> Waneer het koud is, **draagt zij** een jas (when it's cold, she wears a jacket).

Another example:

> Ik werk morgen misschien in Amsterdam (I might be working in Amsterdam tomorrow).

But if I want to emphasize _tomorrow_:

> Morgen werk ik misschien in Amsterdam (**Tomorrow** I might be working in Amsterdam).

## Prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions

A _preposition_ comes before a noun, and describes its location or direction. Examples are _met_ (with), _naar_ to, _voor_ and _achter_ (before and after), _naast_ (next to), _beneden_ and _boven_ (below and above), _onder_ and _over_ (under and over), _bij_ (at or near), _op_ (on), _tussen_ (between), _binnen_ and _buiten_ (inside and outside).

_Postpositions_ come after the word, and are used to describe movement. Examples are _in_ (_Ik loop het bos in_ = I am walking into the forest), _op_ (_Ik ga de berg op_ - I am going up the mountain), _uit_ (_Ik kom mijn kamer uit_ - I am coming out of my room), _omlaag_ and _omhoog_ (down and up), and _vooruit_ and _achteruit_ (forwards and backwards).

Finally, in Dutch they also have _circumpositions_. These are similar to prepositions, but split in two parts that are placed before (i.e. _preposition_) and after (_postposition_). An example is _naartoe_, which in most sentences is split into _naar_ and _toe_ (_Ik ga naar jou toe._ - I am going **towards** you), to imply direction. Here are some more examples:

- _achteraan_: _achter_ and _aan_, to imply moving **behind**.
- _doorheen_: _door_ and _heen_, to imply going **through**.
- _naartoe_: _naar_ and _toe_, to imply going **towards**.
- _omheen_: _om_ and _heen_, to imply going **around**.
- _onderdoor_: _onder_ and _door_, to imply going **underneath**.
- _overheen_: _over_ and _heen_, to imply going **across**.
- _tussendoor_: _tussen_ and _door_, to imply going **in-between**.
- _vanaf_: _van_ and _af_, to imply going **away from**.

## Om + te, or te + infinitive

Signifies purpose and/or reason, and roughly translates as "in order to".

Often used in response to a "Waarom...?" or a "Waarvoor...?" question.

## Reflexives

A reflexive is a verb that is the subject _and_ an object. In English these are phrases like "I wash myself" or "She teaches herself".

Dutch being Dutch, there are several variations (depending on whether the reflexive is stressed or unstressed; or formal or informal).

| English | Dutch (unstressed) | Dutch (stressed) |
| :--     | :--                | :--              |
| Myself  | Me                 | Mezelf           |
| Yourself/ves | Je            | Jezelf           |
| Youself (formal) | Zich      | Uzelf            |
| Himself / Herself / Itself / Themselves | Zich | Zichzelf    |
| Ourselves | Ons              | Onszelf          |

## Tense

### Past tense

#### Past simple

This is used as a 'storytelling tense'. It describes something that happened in the past, as part of a longer story.

Regular verbs are suffixed with either **-de** or **-te**. For example:

- _Leerde_ (Learned)
- _Werkte_ (Worked)
- _Fietste_ (Cycled)

This is unless the stem already ends in a **d** or a **t**, in which case it gets an extra one. For example:

- Ik leerde snel (I learned quickly).
- De mannen praatten de hele nacht (the men were talking all night).

### Present continuous

In Dutch, there are six ways of using present continuous. In other words, there are six ways to say "He is writing":

- Start with a form of _zijn_, followed by _aan het_. So _Hij is aan het schrijven_.
- A verb expressing a physical position (like sitting), followed by the infinitive. So _Hij zit te schrijven_.
- Dramatically (whatever this means; perhaps in some sort of theatre script?), you would say _Hij is schrijvende_.
- To imply busyness: _Hij is bezig met schrijven_. But then there is also _Hij is bezig te schrijven_.
- The subject is away doing some activity, which is when you'd use _zijn_ followed by the infinitive: _Hij is schrijven_.

### Future tense

Future tense is formed as either:

- _Gaan_ + infinitive: To **go**.
- _Zullen_ + infinitive: **Shall** or **will**.

You would use _Zullen_ + infinitive when:

- Something is likely to take place.
- Something will definitely happen.
- To promise or propose something.

## Quirks

Many Dutch words are often used quite differently to English. There are also a number of other arbitrary rules. I'll explain some of the obvious ones in this section.

### Er

Er generally translates to "there", but is often used differently in Dutch.

There are five different ways it can be used in Dutch, so there could be (and may be in future) a separate pages of notes dedicated to this two letter word.

But for now think of it as follows: It is often necessary to include _er_ when the subject is indefinite. And in this case _er_ usually comes after the verb, to place emphasis on it.

For example:

> "Wie slaapt er in mijn bed?" (who is sleeping in my bed?)

### Omdat vs. Want

Both translate to _because_. But...

_Omdat_ is used to give a reason for something:

> Haar huis is blauw, omdat blauw haar lievelingskleur is. (Her house is blue because it's her favourite colour)

_Want_ is used to explain why you said something:

> We moeten snel gaan pauzeren, want ik begin echt moe te worden (We must take a break soon because I am getting really tired).

But a lot of the time, they can be used interchangeably. For example:

> Ik doe de verwarming aan, omdat het koud is. (I switch on the heater because it is cold)

Or:

> Ik doe de verwarming aan, want het is koud. (I switch on the heater because it is cold)

### Geen vs. niet

Use **geen** to negate an **een**:

> Dat is geen man.

And:

> Zij hebben geen boek.

Use **niet** in all other situations:

> Ik ren niet. (I am not running)

And:

> Hij is niet zo oud. (He is not so old)

### Hebt vs. heeft

Does someone _have_ something? If you're talking to someone directly they _hebt_ it. But if you're referring to someone in the third person, they _heeft_ it. For example:

> Je **hebt** een ui. (You have an egg)

But:

> Hij **heeft** een ui. (He has an egg)

### Zo'n vs. zulk/e vs. zoiets

Zo'n is the singular (it's an abbreviation of "such an"), zulk/e is the plural.

Zoiets is "such a thing" or "something like".
