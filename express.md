# Express

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is a web framework for Node.js, and can be used to build networking services and applications.

## Installing Express

After [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), Express can be installed with:

```bash
$ npm install express --save
```

Alternatively, `express` can specified in the `dependencies` in a `package.json` file, and then installed with `npm install -y`.

## Hello world

1. Create a `index.js` file for your code. For example:

```bash
$ touch index.js
```

2. Add the following code to the file:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello world!"));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

This will create a server on port `3000`, that will serve the text `Hello world!` on the path `/`.

3. Start the Express server:

```bash
$ node index.js
```

4. Launch a browser, and navigate to `localhost:3000/` to see the text.

### Hello world explained

So what does the above code actually do?

First, we are importing the `express` package into our application (assigning it the value `express`), and instantiating it.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

Then, we use the `.get()` method to tell the application to listen for GET requests on the path `/`. The `req` and `res` represent the HTTP request and response - both of which can be handled using a callback.
In this case, the callback being used is the [`res.send()`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.send) method, to send the string `"Hello world!"` to the client.

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello world!"));
```

Finally, we're telling the app to start a server, to listen on port 3000. We also log some information to the console, so the human starting the server can see which port the app is listening on.

```js
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

## HTTP methods

Express has built-in methods representing each [HTTP verb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). For example:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  /* callback */
});
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  /* callback */
});
app.put("/", (req, res) => {
  /* callback */
});
app.delete("/", (req, res) => {
  /* callback */
});
app.patch("/", (req, res) => {
  /* callback */
});
```

Each of these accepts a callback function, which is called when the request is started.

## Handling requests

Requests can include data such as parameters, headers, a request body, and more. Here we'll cover off some common use cases that relate to handling requests.

A full list of request callbacks, and details of each, can be found in the [Express documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req).

### Query strings

These are strings that come after a URL path, and are used to pass variables from an HTTP request. Query strings start with a `?`; variables are assigned a value with an `=`; multiple variables are separated with an `&`. For example:

```text
https://www.example.com?name=Sam&username=samcottle
```

#### GET query strings

Express can handle GET query strings using the [`req.query`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query) method. Here's the most simple example:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.query);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

When this server is running, any variables specified in a query string after on the path `/` will be logged as a JSON object to the console (unless there are no variables, in which case an empty object will be logged). The example above would log the following:

```js
{ name: "Sam", username: "samcottle" }
```

##### Other examples

You can access the value of a specific property provided in a query string. For example, the value of `name`:

```js

...
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.query.name);
});

...
```

A `for...in` loop can be used to iterate over all the the properties in a query string:

```js
...

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  for (const key in req.query) {
    console.log(key, req.query[key]);
  }
});

...
```

#### POST query strings

These are typically sent from a form (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), or a POST request that sent JSON data (`Content-Type: application/json`).

POSTed data can be accessed by referencing it from the [`req.body`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.body)(for example, `req.body.name`).

Depending on how the data was sent, you will need to use middleware to handle the data being POSTed.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded()); // Middleware to handle JSON data sent as `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to handle JSON data sent as `Content-Type: application/json`

app.post("/post", (req, res) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(req.body.name);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

## Sending responses

Response types can include data such as objects or arrays, text, and more. Here we'll cover off some of the common use cases that relate to sending responses.

A full list of response callbacks, and details of each, can be found in the [Express documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res).

### Sending a basic response

The Hello world example used [`res.send()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.send) to send a HTTP response, the text string `"Hello world!"`, to the client.

When passing a text string or some HTML into this method, Express automatically sets the `Content-Type` as `text/html`. Similarly, by passing in a JSON object or array the `Content-Type` is set to `application/json` (although `res.json()` should really be used instead).

Once `res.send()` has done its thing, it closes the connection.

### Sending the HTTP response status

The [`res.status()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.status) method can be used to send a [HTTP status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to the client:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/404", (req, res) => res.status(404).send("File not found"));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

If you don't need to send a fancy message to the client then [`res.sendStatus()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.sendStatus) can be used instead. This sends a string representation of the HTTP status to the client. For example:

```js
res.sendStatus(200); // Is equivalent to res.status(200).send('OK')
res.sendStatus(403); // Is equivalent to res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
res.sendStatus(404); // Is equivalent to res.status(404).send('Not Found')
res.sendStatus(500); // Is equivalent to res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error')
```

### Sending JSON

The advised way to send a JSON response is with the [`res.json()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.json) method (as opposed to `res.send({/* JSON here */})`). Any JSON object, array, string, Boolean, number, or `null` can be sent - and any other content will be automatically converted to JSON using [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

```js
...

app.get("/user", (req, res) =>
  res.json({ "name": "Sam", "username": "samcottle" })
);

...
```

### Serving static files

Anything stored in the `/public` subfolder (or any other subfolder) can be exposed at the root level using the `express.static` middleware:

```js
...

app.use(express.static("public")); // or specify a subfolder other than "public"

...
```

If there is, for example, an `index.html` file in this subfolder then this will be served at the root level. But this is commonly used to make images, CSS, or other files available via your server.

### Sending files via download

The [`res.download()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.download) method can be used to transfer a file as a download (i.e. which prompts the user via the browser):

```js
...

// Download a file
app.get("/download", (req, res) => res.download("public/file.pdf");

// Download a file with a custom name
app.get("/download", (req, res) => res.download("public/file.pdf", "your-statement.pdf");

// Download file, then execute code when file has been sent
app.get("/download", (req, res) => res.download("public/file.pdf", "your-statement.pdf", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Some other logic, like decrementing the number of download credits, for example
  }
});

...
```

### Sending an empty response

If you don't have anything to send to the client, the [`res.end()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.end) method can be used to close the connection to the client:

```js
...

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.query);
  res.end();
});

...
```

## Cookies and sessions

Express requests are sequential by default. In other words, requests can't be linked to each other... unless using cookies and/or sessions.

### Usings cookies

The [`res.cookie()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.cookie) method can be used to set or manipulate a cookie.

A basic example of this is to create a cookie containing a username:

```js
...

res.cookie("name", "sam");

...
```

Additional parameters can be passed in an object when setting the cookie, such as the `domain`, whether the cookie should only be used for `secure` sessions, and a date the cookie `expires` (this can also be done with `maxAge`):

```js
...

res.cookie("name", "sam", { domain: ".github.com", path: "/account", secure: true });
res.cookie("name", "sam", { expires: new Date(Date.now() + 900000) });

...
```

The example above set two cookies: one with account details, and another with the expiry date.

Objects can also be passed in the `value` parameter, which can be useful for use cases like tracking the items in a user's shopping cart:

```js
...

res.cookie("cart", { items: [7, 4, 5] }, { maxAge: 900000 });

...
```

For a full list of parameters that can be used when setting cookies, see the [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.cookie).

#### Clearing a cookie

Cookies can be cleared with `res.clearCookie()`, by passing in the name of the cookie (from the example above, this would be `name`):

```js
...

app.get("/admin", (req, res) =>
  res.clearCookie("name");
);

...
```

### Using sessions

When implemented, every user of your API or website is assigned a unique session. This can be used to store a user state.

The simplest way to do this is the [`express-session`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) middleware.

```js
TODO

app.use(session('secret': '343ji43j4n3jn4jk3n')) // This is very rough
```

## Working with HTTP headers

[HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) let a client and server pass additional information in a request or response.

Express can use this to determine authentication information, the type of content that is being transmitted, the client's user agent, and more.

### Accessing request headers

To access _all_ headers included in a request, use the `req.headers` property. For example, to log all the request headers to the console:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.headers);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

Specific headers can be accessed with `req.header`. For example, to log just the `User-Agent` to the console:

```js
...

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.header("User-Agent"));
});

...
```

### Setting response headers

The [`res.set()`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.set) method can be used to specify the HTTP header type of a response. For example, to set the `Content-Type` as `text/html`:

```js
...

res.set("Content-Type", "text/html");

...
```

If you don't need to set anything more than the `Content-Type` header, then [`res.type()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.type) can also be used:

```js
...

res.type(".html"); // Is equivalent to 'text/html'
res.type("html"); // Is equivalent to 'text/html'
res.type("json"); // Is equivalent to 'application/json'
res.type("application/json"); // Is equivalent to 'application/json'
res.type("png"); // Is equivalent to 'image/png'

...
```

In many cases Express will set a `Content-Type` automatically. In this case, [`res.type()`](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.type) can be used to set a different `Content-Type`.

## Routing

Routing determines what happens when a URL is called. For example, what happens when a browser tries to access `/page-x` or `/page-y` on your website:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/page-x", (req, res) => res.send("Welcome to Page X!"));
app.get("/page-y", (req, res) => res.send("Welcome to Page Y!"));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

### Redirecting

If a page or content has moved (i.e. a route no longer exists) it is good practice to redirect users, so they don't get a `404` error page.

The [res.redirect()](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.redirect) method can be used to redirect to a relative or absolute URL, redirect up a level (i.e. `..`), or redirect back (i.e. `back`) to the previous page.

For example, if `/page-x` is deleted, and you want users to go to `/page-z` instead:

```js
...

app.get("/page-x", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect("/page-z");
});

app.get("/page-z", (req, res) => res.send("Welcome to Page Z! We had to delete Page X"));

...
```

### Using RegEx

[Regular expressions](/regex.md) can be used to match multiple paths or routes with one statement. For example, the following will match `/page-x`, `/page-y`, `/pagepagepage`, and any other route with `page` in it.

```js
...

app.get(/page/, (req, res) => res.send("All pages lead to here."));

...
```

### Using named parameters

Let's say we want to build a service that accepts a string and returns that string uppercase (using the [`.toUpperCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) JavaScript method). One way of doing this would be a query string. But we can also use a named parameter in part of the URL:

```js
...

app.get("/uppercase-converter/:namedValue", (req, res) => res.send(req.params.namedValue.toUpperCase()));

...https://www.outsideonline.com/2399404/van-life-difficulties?utm_campaign=facebookpost&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook
```

Now if we send a request to `/uppercase-converter/test`, we get `TEST` in the response body.

## CORS and Preflight

When accessing resources from another domain, subdomain, port, or protocol, some types of requests will fail. Examples include `fetch()` requests, loading a `@font-face`, or an `XMLHttpRequest`. This is behavior is implemented by the browser to prevent potentially malicious content from being loaded.

But if you are sure that there is nothing nefarious going on (e.g. you control the server and the client) then Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be used to allow resources to be shared. The simplest way to do this is to include the `cors` middleware in your app:

```js
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

app.get("/no-cors", (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ msg: "Uh-oh, no CORS :(" });
});

app.get("/cors", cors(), (req, res, next) => {
  res.json({ msg: "Works with CORS :)" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

## Using middleware

Middleware is a function that is inserted into the routing process, and performs an operation (e.g. edit the request or response object, or terminate a request before some code executes).

Using [middleware in Express](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html) is similar to defining a route, but in addition to the `req` and `res` objects, there is a `next` function:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  /* code here */
});
```

The `next` function is used to pass the execution to the next handler, after the middleware has been executed.

An example of middleware is [`cookie-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser), which is used to parse cookie headers into a `req.cookies` object. After installing the package from NPM, you can use it in your app:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello world!"));

app.use(cookieParser());
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server ready on port 3000"));
```

The code above will use `cookie-parser` on all routes. But you can also set middleware to only run on specific routes by using it as the second parameter when defining a route:

```js
...

const middleware = (req, res, next) => {
  /* code here */
  next();
}

app.get("/", middleware, (req, res) => res.send("Hello world!"));

...
```

Data stored by middleware is available in the `req.locals` object. For example, if middleware stored a `name` with the value `"Sam"`:

```js
console.log(req.locals.name); // Logs "Sam"
```
