# Sailing notes

## Terms

### Sides of the boat

- **Bow**: The front.
- **Stern**: The back.
- **Port**: The left side.
- **Starboard**: The right side.

### Tacking

Technique used to sail **upwind**, by moving the bow from one side of the wind to the other.

A **port tack** is a tack where the wind is hitting the _port side_ of the boat (i.e. you're actually turning _to_ starboard).

A **starboard tack** is a tack where the wind is hitting the _starboard side_ of the boat (i.e. you're actually turning _to_ port).

### Gybing

Technique used to sail **downwind**, by moving the bow from one side of the wind to the other.

In strong or gusty winds, an alternative is to do a _chicken gybe_. Instead of moving the bow directly across the wind by 90 degrees, you move it 270 degrees in the opposite direction (360 - 270 = 90). 

### Heave to

Technique for slowing and stopping a sailboat. For example, when you need to take a break from sailing, or when there is strong wind.

Achieved by:

1. Easing the mainsail.
2. Backing the jib to the windward side.
3. Fixing the rudder as if you want to turn into the wind.

## Right of way rules

When sailing in Dutch inland waterways (i.e. canals, rivers, etc.) you need to adhere to certain rules. These define which vessel has right of way (`>`) over others. 

The rules, in order, are:

1. Good seamanship (i.e. be safe, aware of surroundings, avoid restricted areas, etc.).
2. Starboard side of the waterway > everyone.
3. Big > small (where big = 20m+).
4. Sail > muscle > engine.
5. Starboard tack (tack to the left) > port tack (tack to the right). Basically, the boat getting hit by wind on starboard has priority.
6. Leeward > Windward.

Different rules apply in other countries, or in open water.
