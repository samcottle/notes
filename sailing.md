# Sailing notes

## Terms

### Sides of the boat

- **Bow**: The front.
- **Stern**: The back.
- **Port**: The left side.
- **Starboard**: The right side.

### Tacking

Technique used to sailing upwind, by moving the bow from one side of the wind to the other.

A **port tack** is a tack where the wind is hitting the _port side_ of the boat (i.e. you're actually turning _to_ starboard).

A **starboard tack** is a tack where the wind is hitting the _starboard side_ of the boat (i.e. you're actually turning _to_ port).

### Gybing

Technique used to sailing downwind, by moving the bow from one side of the wind to the other.

A variation on this, often used in strong or gusty winds, is to do a 'chicken gybe'. Instead of moving the bow 90 degrees across the wind, you move it 270 degrees in the opposite direction. So it's a bit like taking 3x left turns instead of 1x right turn (or vice versa).

### Heave to

Technique for slowing and stopping a sailboat. For example, when you need to take a break from sailing, or when there is strong wind.

Achieved by:

1. Easing the mainsail.
2. Backing the jib to the windward side.
3. Fixing the rudder as if you want to turn into the wind.

## Right of way rules

These rules are for Dutch inland waterways (i.e. canals, rivers, etc.). Different rules apply depending on where you sail.

The rules, in order, are:

1. Good seamanship (i.e. be safe, aware of your surroundings, avoid restricted areas, etc.).
2. Starboard side > everyone.
3. Big > small (big == 20m+).
4. Sail > muscle > engine.
5. Starboard tack (tack to the left) > port tack (tack to the right).
6. Windward > Leeward.
